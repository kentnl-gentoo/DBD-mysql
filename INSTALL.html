<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION</A></H1>
<P>This document describes the installation and configuration of
DBD::mysql, the Perl DBI driver for the MySQL database. Before
reading on, make sure that you have the prerequisites available:
Perl, MySQL and DBI. For details see the separate section.
<A HREF="#prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</A>.</P>
<P>Depending on your version of Perl, it might be possible to
use a binary distribution of DBD::mysql. If possible, this is
recommended. Otherwise you need to install from the sources.
If so, you will definitely need a C compiler. Installation
from binaries and sources are both described in separate
sections. <A HREF="#binary installation">BINARY INSTALLATION</A>. <A HREF="#source installation">SOURCE INSTALLATION</A>.</P>
<P>Finally, if you encounter any problems, do not forget to
read the section on known problems. <A HREF="#known problems">KNOWN PROBLEMS</A>. If
that doesn't help, you should look into the archive of the
mailing list <STRONG><A HREF="mailto:msql-mysql-modules@lists.mysql.com">msql-mysql-modules@lists.mysql.com</A></STRONG>. See
<A HREF="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</A> for archive locations. And if that
still doesn't help, please post a question on this mailing
list.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="prerequisites">PREREQUISITES</A></H1>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Perl">Perl</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Preferrably a version of Perl, that comes preconfigured with
your system. For example, all Linux and FreeBSD distributions
come with Perl. For Windows, ActivePerl is recommended, see
<A HREF="http://www.activestate.com">http://www.activestate.com</A> for details.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_MySQL">MySQL</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
You need not install the actual MySQL database server, the
client files and the devlopment files are sufficient. For
example, the Red Hat Linux distribution comes with RPM files
<STRONG>mysql-client</STRONG> and <STRONG>mysql-devel</STRONG>. These are sufficient,
if the MySQL server is located on a foreign machine. You may
also create client files by compiling from the MySQL source
distribution and using
<PRE>
  configure --without-server</PRE>
<P>If you are using Windows and need to compile from sources
(which is only the case if you are not using ActivePerl),
then you must ensure that the header and library files are
installed. This may require choosing a ``Custom installation''
and selecting the appropriate option when running the
MySQL setup program.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_DBI">DBI</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
DBD::mysql is a DBI driver, hence you need DBI. It is available
from the same source where you got the DBD::mysql distribution
from.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_C_compiler">C compiler</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
A C compiler is only required, if you install from source. In
most cases there are binary distributions of DBD::mysql
available. However, if you need a C compiler, make sure, that
it is the same C compiler that was used for compiling Perl and
MySQL! Otherwise you will almost definitely encounter problems
because of differences in the underlying C runtime libraries.
<P>In the worst case, this might mean to compile Perl and MySQL
yourself. But believe me, experience shows that a lot of problems
are fixed this way.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Gzip_libraries">Gzip libraries</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Late versions of MySQL come with support for compression. Thus
it <STRONG>may</STRONG> be required that you have install an RPM package like
libz-devel, libgz-devel or something similar.
<P></P></DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="binary installation">BINARY INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>Binary installation is possible in the most cases, depending
on your system. I give some examples:</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="windows">Windows</A></H2>
<P>ActivePerl offers a PPM archive of DBD::mysql. All you need to
do is typing</P>
<PRE>
  ppm
  install DBI
  install DBD-mysql</PRE>
<P>This will fetch the modules via HTTP and install them. If you
need to use a WWW proxy server, the environment variable
HTTP_proxy must be set:</P>
<PRE>
  set HTTP_proxy=<A HREF="http://my.proxy.server:8000/">http://my.proxy.server:8000/</A>
  ppm
  install DBI
  install DBD-mysql</PRE>
<P>Of course you need to replace the host name <CODE>my.proxy.server</CODE>
and the port number <CODE>8000</CODE> with your local values.</P>
<P>If the above procedure doesn't work, please upgrade to the latest
version of ActivePerl. Versions before build 623 are known to
have problems.</P>
<P>PPM 3 is said to miss DBD::mysql in the repository. Thus use of
PPM 3 is discouraged, in favour of PPM 2. If you need to use
PPM 3, try</P>
<PRE>
  ppm
  rep add PPM2 <A HREF="http://ppm.activestate.com/PPMPackages/5.6plus/">http://ppm.activestate.com/PPMPackages/5.6plus/</A>
  rep 2
  install DBI
  install DBD-mysql</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="red hat linux">Red Hat Linux</A></H2>
<P>As of version 7.1, Red Hat Linux comes with MySQL and DBD::mysql.
You need to ensure that the following RPM's are installed:</P>
<PRE>
  mysql
  perl-DBI
  perl-DBD-MySQL</PRE>
<P>For installation from source the following RPM's are required</P>
<PRE>
  mysql-devel
  libz-devel</PRE>
<P>Optional are</P>
<PRE>
  mysql-server</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="other systems">Other systems</A></H2>
<P>In the case of Linux or FreeBSD distributions it is very likely
that all you need comes with your distribution, as in the case
of Red Hat Linux. I just cannot give you names, as I am not using
these systems.</P>
<P>Please let me know if you find the files in your SuSE Linux, Debian
Linux or FreeBSD distribution so that I can extend the above list.</P>
<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="source installation">SOURCE INSTALLATION</A></H1>
<P>So you need to install from sources. If you are lucky, the Perl
module <CODE>CPAN</CODE> will do all for you, thanks to the excellent work
of Andreas Koenig. Otherwise you will need to do a manual
installation. Some of you, in particular system administrators
of multiple sites, will choose automatic installation. All of
these installation types have an own section. <A HREF="#cpan installation">CPAN installation</A>.
<A HREF="#manual installation">Manual installation</A>. <A HREF="#configuration">Configuration</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="cpan installation">CPAN installation</A></H2>
<P>Installation of DBD::mysql can be incredibly easy:</P>
<PRE>
  cpan
  install DBD::mysql</PRE>
<P>If you are using the CPAN module for the first time, just answer
the questions by accepting the defaults which are fine in most
cases. If you are using an older version of Perl, you might
instead need a</P>
<PRE>
  perl -MCPAN -e shell
  install DBD::mysql</PRE>
<P>If you cannot get the CPAN module working, you might try manual
installation. If installation with CPAN fails because the your
local settings have been guessed wrong, you might try to
create a script called <CODE>mysql_config</CODE>. This is described in
more details later. <A HREF="#configuration">Configuration</A>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="manual installation">Manual installation</A></H2>
<P>For a manual installation you need to fetch the DBD::mysql
source distribution. The latest version is always available
from</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/">http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/DBD/</A></PRE>
<P>The name is typically something like</P>
<PRE>
  DBD-mysql-1.2216.tar.gz</PRE>
<P>The archive needs to be extracted. On Windows you may use a tool
like WinZip, on Unix you type</P>
<PRE>
  gzip -cd DBD-mysql-1.2216.tar.gz | tar xf -</PRE>
<P>This will create a subdirectory DBD-mysql-1.2216. Enter this
subdirectory and type</P>
<PRE>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test</PRE>
<P>(On Windows you may need to replace ``make'' with ``nmake'' or
``dmake''.) If the tests seem to look fine, you may continue with</P>
<PRE>
  make install</PRE>
<P>If the tests fail, you might need to configure some settings.
For example you might choose a different database, the C
compiler or the linker might need some flags. <A HREF="#configuration">Configuration</A>.
<A HREF="#c compiler flags">C Compiler flags</A>. <A HREF="#linker flags">Linker flags</A>.</P>
<P>For Windows/CygWin there is a special section below.
<EM>Windows/CygWin</EM>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="configuration">Configuration</A></H2>
<P>The install script ``Makefile.PL'' can be configured via a lot of
switches. All switches can be used on the command line. For
example, the test database:</P>
<PRE>
  perl Makefile.PL --testdb=&lt;db&gt;</PRE>
<P>If you do not like configuring these switches on the command
line, you may alternatively create a script called <CODE>mysql_config</CODE>.
This is described later on.</P>
<P>Available switches are:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_testdb">testdb</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Name of the test database, defaults to <STRONG>test</STRONG>.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_testuser">testuser</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Name of the test user, defaults to empty. If the name is empty,
then the currently logged in users name will be used.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_testpassword">testpassword</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Password of the test user, defaults to empty.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_testhost">testhost</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Host name or IP number of the test database; defaults to localhost.
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_testport">testport</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
Port number of the test database
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_cflags">cflags</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is a list of flags that you want to give to the C compiler.
The most important flag is the location of the MySQL header files.
For example, on Red Hat Linux the header files are in /usr/include/mysql
and you might try
<PRE>
  -I/usr/include/mysql</PRE>
<P>On Windows the header files may be in C:\mysql\include and you might try</P>
<PRE>
  -IC:\mysql\include</PRE>
<P>The default flags are determined by running</P>
<PRE>
  mysql_config --cflags</PRE>
<P>More details on the C compiler flags can be found in the following
section. <A HREF="#c compiler flags">C Compiler flags</A>.</P>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_libs">libs</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
This is a list of flags that you want to give to the linker
or loader. The most important flags are the locations and names
of additional libraries. For example, on Red Hat Linux your
MySQL client libraries are in /usr/lib/mysql and you might try
<PRE>
  -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient -lz</PRE>
<P>On Windows the libraries may be in C:\mysql\lib and</P>
<PRE>
  -LC:\mysql\lib -lmysqlclient</PRE>
<P>might be a good choice. The default flags are determined by running</P>
<PRE>
  mysql_config --libs</PRE>
<P>More details on the linker flags can be found in a separate section.
<A HREF="#linker flags">Linker flags</A>.</P>
<P></P></DL>
<P>If a switch is not present on the command line, then the
script <CODE>mysql_config</CODE> will be executed. This script comes
as part of the MySQL distribution. For example, to determine
the C compiler flags, we are executing</P>
<PRE>
  mysql_config --cflags
  mysql_config --libs</PRE>
<P>If you want to configure your own settings for database name,
database user and so on, then you have to create a script with
the same name, that replies</P>
<P></P>
<PRE>

=head2 C Compiler flags</PRE>
<P>It is typically not so difficult to determine the appropriate
flags for the C compiler. The linker flags, which you find in
the next section, are another story.</P>
<P>The determination of the C compiler flags is usually left to
a configuration script called <EM>mysql_config</EM>, which can be
invoked with</P>
<PRE>
  mysql_config --cflags</PRE>
<P>When doing so, it will emit a line with suggested C compiler
flags, for example like this:</P>
<PRE>
  -L/usr/include/mysql</PRE>
<P>The C compiler must find some header files. Header files have
the extension <CODE>.h</CODE>. MySQL header files are, for example,
<EM>mysql.h</EM> and <EM>mysql_version.h</EM>. In most cases the header
files are not installed by default. For example, on Windows
it is an installation option of the MySQL setup program
(Custom installation), whether the header files are installed
or not. On Red Hat Linux, you need to install an RPM archive
<EM>mysql-devel</EM> or <EM>MySQL-devel</EM>.</P>
<P>If you know the location of the header files, then you will
need to add an option</P>
<PRE>
  -L&lt;header directory&gt;</PRE>
<P>to the C compiler flags, for example <CODE>-L/usr/include/mysql</CODE>.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="linker flags">Linker flags</A></H2>
<P>Appropriate linker flags are the most common source of problems
while installing DBD::mysql. I will only give a rough overview,
you'll find more details in the troubleshooting section.
<A HREF="#known problems">KNOWN PROBLEMS</A></P>
<P>The determination of the C compiler flags is usually left to
a configuration script called <EM>mysql_config</EM>, which can be
invoked with</P>
<PRE>
  mysql_config --libs</PRE>
<P>When doing so, it will emit a line with suggested C compiler
flags, for example like this:</P>
<PRE>
   -L'/usr/lib/mysql' -lmysqlclient -lnsl -lm   -lz -lcrypt</PRE>
<P>The following items typically need to be configured for the
linker:</P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The_mysqlclient_library">The mysqlclient library</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The MySQL client library comes as part of the MySQL distribution.
Depending on your system it may be a file called
<PRE>
  F&lt;libmysqlclient.a&gt;   statically linked library, Unix
  F&lt;libmysqlclient.so&gt;  dynamically linked library, Unix
  F&lt;mysqlclient.lib&gt;    statically linked library, Windows
  F&lt;mysqlclient.dll&gt;    dynamically linked library, Windows</PRE>
<P>or something similar.</P>
<P>As in the case of the header files, the client library is typically
not installed by default. On Windows you will need to select them
while running the MySQL setup program (Custom installation). On
Red Hat Linux an RPM archive <EM>mysql-devel</EM> or <EM>MySQL-devel</EM> must
be installed.</P>
<P>The linker needs to know the location and name of the mysqlclient
library. This can be done by adding the flags</P>
<PRE>
  -L&lt;lib directory&gt; -lmysqlclient</PRE>
<P>or by adding the complete path name. Examples:</P>
<PRE>
  -L/usr/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
  -LC:\mysql\lib -lmysqlclient</PRE>
<P>If you would like to use the static libraries (and there are
excellent reasons to do so), you need to create a separate
directory, copy the static libraries to that place and use
the -L switch above to point to your new directory. For example:</P>
<PRE>
  mkdir /tmp/mysql-static
  cp /usr/lib/mysql/*.a /tmp/mysql-static
  perl Makefile.PL --libs=&quot;-L/tmp/mysql-static -lmysqlclient&quot;
  make
  make test
  make install
  rm -rf /tmp/mysql-static</PRE>
<P></P>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_The_gzip_library">The gzip library</A></STRONG><BR>
<DD>
The MySQL client can use compression when talking to the MySQL
server, a nice feature when sending or receiving large texts over
a slow network.
<P>On Unix you typically find the appropriate file name by running</P>
<PRE>
  ldconfig -p | grep libz
  ldconfig -p | grep libgz</PRE>
<P>Once you know the name (libz.a or libgz.a is best), just add it
to the list of linker flags. If this seems to be causing problem
you may also try to link without gzip libraries.</P>

additional modules usually works as a charme via the standard
procedure of</P>
<PRE>
    perl makefile.PL
    make

    make install</PRE>
<P>The Windows binary distribution of MySQL runs smoothly under Cygwin.
You can start/stop the server and use all Windows clients without problem.
But to install DBD::mysql you have to take a little special action.</P>
<P>Don't attempt to build DBD::mysql against either the MySQL Windows or
Linux/Unix BINARY distributions: neither will work!</P>
<P>You MUST compile the MySQL clients yourself under Cygwin, to get a
'libmysqlclient.a' compiled under Cygwin. Really! You'll only need
that library and the header files, you don't need any other client parts.
Continue to use the Windows binaries. And don't attempt (currently) to
build the MySQL Server part, it is unneccessary, as MySQL AB does an
excellent job to deliver optimized binaries for the mainstream
operating systems, and it is told, that the server compiled under Cygwin is
unstable.</P>

There are known problems with shared versions of libmysqlclient,
at least on some Linux boxes. If you receive an error message
similar to
<PRE>
  install_driver(mysql) failed: Can't load
  '/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/i586-linux/auto/DBD/mysql/mysql.so'
  for module DBD::mysql: File not found at
  /usr/lib/perl5/i586-linux/5.00404/DynaLoader.pm line 166</PRE>
<P>then this error message can be misleading: It's not mysql.so
that fails being loaded, but libmysqlclient.so! The usual
problem is that this file is located in a directory like</P>
<PRE>
  /usr/lib/mysql</PRE>
<P>where the linker doesn't look for it.</P>
<P>The best workaround is using a statically linked mysqlclient
library, for example</P>
<PRE>
  /usr/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.a</PRE>
<P>The use of a statically linked library is described in the
previous section on linker flags. <A HREF="#configuration">Configuration</A>.
<A HREF="#linker flags">Linker flags</A>.</P>

Red Hat 8 &amp; 9 set the Default locale to UTF which causes problems with 
MakeMaker.  To build DBD::mysql on these systems, do a 'unset LANG' 
before runing 'perl Makefile.PL'
