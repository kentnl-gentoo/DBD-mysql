DBD::mysql - A Perl5 Database Interface to the MySQL database
=============================================================

The driver installation is described in

  INSTALL.html

In short: If you are using

  ActivePerl/Windows:

    1.) If you need to use an HTTP Proxy, set the environment
        variable http_proxy, for example like this:

          set http_proxy=http://myproxy.com:8080/

    2.) The actual installation is as simple as

	  ppm install DBI
          ppm install DBD::mysql

        As of this writing, the above procedure won't work with
        ActivePerl 5.8.0, because so far a PPM for DBD::mysql is
        not available from the ActiveState server. I don't know
        why. However, Randy Kobes has kindly donated a PPM package
        to his own repository. You can use this as follows:

          ppm install http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/ppms/DBD-mysql.ppd

  Red Hat Linux 7.1 (you may prefer gnorpm)

    rpm -i mysql mysql-devel mysql-server
    rpm -i perl-DBI
    rpm -i DBD-MySQL
    rpm -i zlib-devel

  SuSE Linux 7.2 (you may prefer yast)

    rpm -i mysql mysql-client mysql-devel mysql-shared
    rpm -i perl-DBI
    rpm -i perl-Msql-Mysql-modules

  Mandrake Linux 8.0 (any Mandrake specific installation tool?)

    rpm -i MySQL MySQL-client MySQL-devel MySQL-shared
    rpm -i perl-DBI
    rpm -i perl-Mysql
    rpm -i zlib-devel

  Debian Linux

    Install the packages

      mysql-client mysql-server mysql-doc mysql-common
      libdbi-perl lidbd-mysql-perl

    No idea how one does install these under Debian, but I am
    sure you know. :-)      

  For others, or in case of problems see INSTALL.html.
